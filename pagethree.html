        <p id="technologies">
          My name is Julie DeMasters and I am a Full-Stack Web Development student at Galvanize. I found myself eating at the same restaurants whenever I would go out with my friends or family so I decided to develop a website that encourages users to try new restaurants in their city. I only provide three random choices to the user with the intention of minimizing the stress in choosing a restaurant by having too many choices.

          The project intended to solve the problem of continually eating at the same restaurants in user's hometowns through an original website that is easy to interact with. The website allows users to search for three random restaurants based upon the user input. The website was created with semantic HTML, CSS, a mix of Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. The API for Zomato.com, a restaurant website that provides reviews, menus, addresses and cuisine types was used to pull the data onto the website. The workflow that was followed was agile process management. The first stage was HTML, followed by CSS and finally the functionality of the website was developed using JavaScript.
